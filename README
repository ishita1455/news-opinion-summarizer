# 📰 News Opinion & Editorial Summarizer

## 📌 Overview

This project provides a **fully automated pipeline** to process English newspaper PDFs. It:

1. Identifies pages containing **Opinion / Editorial / Views** sections.
2. Extracts only those relevant pages.
3. Merges them into a **single consolidated PDF**.
4. Generates **summaries** of the extracted content using the Groq LLM.
5. Runs seamlessly on **Windows and Linux** with minimal human intervention.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Automated extraction of editorial/opinion pages.
* ✅ **OCR fallback** for scanned PDFs using Tesseract.
* ✅ **Header-based detection**: identifies “Editorial”, “Opinion”, “Views”, “Letters”.
* ✅ **Merged PDF output**: combines all relevant pages into one file.
* ✅ **Summarization with Groq API** for concise insights.
* ✅ Works cross-platform (Windows/Linux).
* ✅ Detailed **logging** of processed files and extracted pages.

If you want, I can also **add badges, links, and a cleaner Table of Contents** to make it look even more professional on GitHub.

Do you want me to do that next?
